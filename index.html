      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I am a sommelier, restaurant manager and entrepreneur with a passion for
        software development. I am also eager to take my passion to the next
        level and completely change my career.<br />
        As an entrepreneur, I dream to set up a company to develop web and
        mobile apps that improve people's quality of life, the environment and
        even our behaviour as humans.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>
        I was born in Lisbon, specifically in Chiado but lived most of my life
        near Sintra.<br />In case you don't know, these are in Portugal.

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        My favourite hobby, for now, is learning how to code. When it becomes a
        career, it will be tasting wine and visit wineries.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Founder/CTO of a "Unicorn" Company... :-)</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In Leamington Spa, United Kingdom</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>
        The main reason is a bit childish maybe. Do you know when you are trying
        to solve a problem and you finally get it? You become full of pride and
        satisfaction. When writing code this happens to me all the time.
        Although it can be a frustrating road sometimes, it's really awesome
        when I get that thing to work!
